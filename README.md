# Rossmann-Store-Sales
Simple Deep Learning Project

# Overview.

This project aims to predict the daily sales for the Rossmann stores using historical data. The goal is to build a machine learning model using Keras to predict sales for each store based on various features such as the day of the week, promotions, weather, and store-specific data.

#Libraries.

- pandas and numpy: for data manipulation
- matplotlib and seaborn: for data visualization
